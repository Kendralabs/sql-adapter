# SQL-Adapter

This connector accesses a defined SQL/MySQL/PostgreSQL database and fetches data based on the provided query .

## Authorization
Each request to the database might require authorization. To do so, pass your imap settings through the config.

The following is an example for the minimal config for the SQL-Adapter step in the flow:

`{
  databaseType: 'MySQL',
  user: 'User1',
  password: 'abcdefg',
  databaseUrl: 'localhost',
  port: '3306',
  databaseName: 'DB1',
  query: 'SELECT * FROM sometable WHERE FROM_UNIXTIME(timestamp) > CURDATE() - INTERVAL 1 DAY'
}`

This connector also supports custom mapping via JSONATA in the step-config ex:

`customMapping: '{\'fullName\': data.title & \' \' & data.firstName & \' \' & data.lastName}'`

## Actions and triggers
The **adapter** supports the following **actions** and **triggers**:

#### Triggers:
  - Fetch data from SQL database - polling (```getDataPolling.js```)

  All triggers are of type '*polling'* which means that the **trigger** will be scheduled to execute periodically.

  It will send the provided SQL-QUERY to the connected database account and fetches the resulting data row by row. It is recommended to create a separate database user with the required permission.

  ---
  But will only send data that is new or changed since the previous execution. Then it will emit one message per object that is added or changed since the last polling interval.

  For this case at the very beginning we just create an empty `snapshot` object. Later on we attach ``lastUpdated`` to it. At the end the entire object should be emitted as the message body.
  ---

#### Actions:
  - Write Query to MySQL database (```addData.js```)

  All placeholders in the query will be replaced with data if found.

  Example:

  Query:
  `INSERT INTO address_company (email) VALUES ("{email}")`

  payload:

  `{ email: 'testmail@testmail.test' }`

  Will result in:

  `INSERT INTO address_company (email) VALUES ("testmail@testmail.test")`

  This is not a prepared statement.
